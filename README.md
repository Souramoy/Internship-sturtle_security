# Internship-sturtle_security


### Exam Website

This project is a web-based exam platform designed to provide a secure and user-friendly environment for online assessments. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and intuitive interface for users. Key features include the ability to take tests with multiple-choice questions, real-time results, and user account management for tracking past performance and upcoming exams.

The backend is powered by PHP, which manages user authentication, dynamic content, and exam submissions. Data is stored and managed in MySQL, allowing for efficient handling of user data, questions, and results.

To ensure exam integrity, the platform incorporates advanced anti-cheating mechanisms such as auto video, audio, and screen recording during the test session. Additionally, it includes features like anti-tab change detection, anti-tab minimization, and restrictions on multi-window operations, making it highly secure for academic or professional assessments.

This platform is versatile and can be adapted for various testing scenarios, offering a secure, scalable solution for online exams.
